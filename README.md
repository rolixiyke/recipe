# Frontend Mentor - Recipe Page Solution

This is my solution to the [Recipe Page Challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm). This challenge helped me reinforce my HTML & CSS skills by replicating a clean and responsive recipe page layout.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic **HTML5**
- Modern **CSS3** (including custom properties)
- **Flexbox** and **Responsive Media Queries**
- **Mobile-first** workflow
- Plain **Vanilla CSS** (no frameworks)
- Clean, maintainable **folder structure**

### What I Learned

While working on this challenge, I deepened my understanding of:
- Structuring HTML semantically for accessibility
- Applying mobile-first responsive design with media queries
- Using CSS to replicate real-world layouts
- Styling tables, lists, and text elements consistently

#### Sample Code:
css
@media (min-width: 900px) {
  .servings {
    padding: 2.5rem 3rem;
    margin: 3rem auto;
    max-width: 800px;
  }
}

### Continued Development

In future projects, Iâ€™d like to:

* Explore using utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS
* Convert this project into a reusable React component
* Improve accessibility by adding ARIA roles and screen reader support

### Useful Resources
